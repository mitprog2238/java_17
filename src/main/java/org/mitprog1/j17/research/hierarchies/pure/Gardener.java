 * The problem #:
 *  There is an assumption that developers have to deal with in the last else construct,
 *  which is to define actions even though they are sure that all possible types of the method parameters have been already addressed.
 *  In the preceding code, the code in the last else block might look unreachable now,
 *  but what happens if some other developer adds a class to this hierarchy?
 *  Also, the compiler canâ€™t help the method process to check whether it has handled all the subclasses.
